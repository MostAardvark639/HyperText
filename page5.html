	<h1> Don't read German? Here ya go. </h1>
<br>
Sadness flows as the Tequila ebbs
<br>
Under the weight of pressure <br>

Trying to maintain <br>
Working to sustain <br>

My love of life <br>
Life if for laughter<br> 
Laughing with firends<br>
Loved ones and smiles<br>
It changes the flow through the body<br>
Brings the happiness that only friends can give<br>
